Game Title: Parkour Dino

Game objective: This game was influenced by the Dino Runner game built into Google Chrome. In this game of hardcore parkour Dino, you need to avoid any obstacle that comes your way. Use the space bar to jump over the flying dragons. Get hit by any dragon and you will lose a life. Lose all of your lives and you lose the game. Utilize the powerups to survive longer. The lightning bolt allows you to double jump for a short time. The heart gives you more lives, and the coin boosts your score.
